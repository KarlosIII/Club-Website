# Club Website project

## About the project

The Club Website project on Codecademy is a practical exercise focused on HTML/CSS, with a particular emphasis on flexbox techniques. I chose to create my project in the style of a vintage video game website, reminiscent of the days when webpages were crafted for gaming clans, guilds, and groupsâ€”long before platforms like Discord existed. This fictional site features original content created entirely by me, including even the pizza discount!
